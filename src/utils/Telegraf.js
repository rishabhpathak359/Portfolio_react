          <p>Hey buddy,</p>
          <p>What are u looking for, do u wanna know about me? But I don't even know about myself. I'm happy sometimes
            but suddenly fall depressed without any reason ✨</p>
          <p>Are u depressed?</p>
          <p>Close ur eyes, take a deep breath, hear what I say, life is a circus dear, even 69 gets views🌚. If you're
            alone, enjoy that loneliness, there are so many people who try to be happy in front of others, but they
            can't. It's okay what you are, what's your past, focus on your future ⚕️, dreamt about it, prepare a speech
            to be presented when you are successful in the future 🔍. Success begins when you realize what you are 🌘
            and what people are.</p>
          <p>The truth is I don't even know what I'm saying 😂👻. Be happy dude ❤, find your happiness, it's around you
            inside you 🔍, search it.</p>
          <p>And yes, I have mentioned like literally nothing about me here 😅 because they are beyond your imagination.
            😎</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>THANK YOU 😊<br /> Apka apna Rishabh:)</p>
        </div>
